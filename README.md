## 📊 Problem Overview

Traditional signal processing techniques like **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** often struggle with the **non-stationary nature** of vibration signals. This project addresses those limitations by leveraging:

- **Cyclostationary properties** of vibration signals
- **SCD image generation** from time-series data
- **CNN-based image classification** for fault detection
